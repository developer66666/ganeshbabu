 <h2>ABOUT</h2>

    <p>My name is Ganesh, and I am currently working as a Software Engineer at Swatantra Systems Pvt Ltd. I have around 4.8 years of experience specializing in SQL and PL/SQL development and support</p>

    <p>I have good knowledge in SQL object, statements, function, joins, sub query in plsql cursor, 
stored procedure, functions, packages, trigger, collections, and I have good knowledge in performance tuning, 
including query tuning and plsql block tuning.
    </p>

    <p>Currently, I am working on an Enterprise Banking Workflow Automation and Data Integration project, where I am actively involved in the Inventory and Accounts modules. My primary responsibilities include handling change requests (CRs) and work requests (WRs).</p>

    <p>I have designed and developed PL/SQL procedures, functions, packages, and triggers for financial workflows, including Current Account (CA), Cash & Banking (CB), Accounts Payable (AP), and Accounts Receivable (AR).</p>

    <p>On a daily basis, we start with a stand-up meeting from 10:30 AM to 11:00 AM, where we discuss our progress and new requirements. My manager assigns tasks based on work requests and change requests, and I prepare process specification documents before proceeding with development.</p>

    <p>Once the development is complete, I prepare a code review document consisting of the code script and application flow screenshots. After receiving feedback, I make necessary corrections and resubmit for approval. Upon receiving the sign-off, the code is forwarded to the testing team, and after successful testing, we send release to onsite team</p>

    <p>I use tools like SQL Developer for my coding, and JIRA for tracking tasks, and SVN for managing the code.</p>

    <p>Additionally I have 1.8 years of experience in developing and customizing WordPress websites, themes, plugins, and setting up WooCommerce stores for clients.</p>
